Conference Policies

ANTI-HARASSMENT

RubyConf 2013 is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not deemed appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating any of these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference, at the discretion of the conference organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to: offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and any unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns regarding violations of this policy, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.

Conference staff are happy to help participants contact venue staff or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or in any other way assist those experiencing harassment. Having a safe environment for our conference participants is of paramount importance to us, and we value your help towards creating this space.

RubyConf participants are subject to this policy at all conference and conference-related social events.
