We value the participation of each member of the community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all conference events.

To make clear what is expected, all delegates, speakers, exhibitors and volunteers at any RubyConf Uruguay event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. RubyConf Uruguay is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for RubyConf Uruguay.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference without a refund at the sole discretion of the conference organizers. Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.
